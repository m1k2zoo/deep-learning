# deep-learning
This is a playground where I implement some of the deep learning concepts I am learning in class. The ANNs and CNNs folders contain
implementations of basic architectures, and some experimenting with hyperparameters. The biomed_applications folder contain 
demonstrations of applying deep learning techniques to solve problems in biomedical imaging.
